### Fakes
#### Screenshots:
![item price fake unittest](./item_price/item_price_fake_unittest.png)

#### Summary:
Fake testing for "item_price" is written in different file "item_price_fake". It's functions is same as item_price, but it makes its own file for testing.

#### Reflections:
Fakes is good in unit and integration testing, when tester doesn't want to use real inputs/outputs from the code.
